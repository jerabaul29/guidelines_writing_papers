# guidelines_writing_papers

My personal guidelines writing papers - things that come up again and again. Crisp and effective writing is hard, and applying these is a constant struggle, this is perfectly normal :) .

Suggest extra guidelines in issues.

## Style [S]

- **S0**: avoid strong adjectives / hyperboles, especially if vague: i.e. avoid qualificators like "very", "the most", etc.
- **S1**: use present tense, avoid complex present / future / past mix in a paper: i.e., write "we show", "we do", etc.
- **S2**: write short sentences, with simple structure: "Subject, Verb, Complement". Keep 1 idea per sentence. Keep long sentences into shorter sentences.
- **S3**: use consistent terminology. In literature, we like using different words to describe the same "thing", to avoid heavy, ugly repetitions. In scientific writing, the simpler the better, and a given "thing" should be referred consistently by the same word(s), even if this leads to repetitions.

## Figures [F]

- **F1**: have detailed captions for figures (and Tables). Ideally, it should be possible for someone with knowledge of the field to read just the abstract, conclusion, and figures + captions, and get a good understanding of the paper and results. Have detailed captions that have all the information needed to read and understand the figures without the need to read the text fishing for information, even if this results in long captions. Also have a short word of discussion (the "why" / "what this shows"), to explain what this figure shows and what its point is.
